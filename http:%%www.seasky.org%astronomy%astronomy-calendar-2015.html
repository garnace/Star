      <p >This <strong>astronomy calendar of celestial events</strong> contains dates for notable celestial events including <strong>moon phases</strong>, <strong>meteor showers</strong>, <strong>eclipses</strong>, <strong>oppositions</strong>, <strong>conjunctions</strong>, and other interesting events. Most of the astronomical events on this calendar can be seen with unaided eye, although some may require a good pair of binoculars for best viewing. Many of these events and dates used here were obtained from the <a href="http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO" target="_blank">U.S. Naval Observatory</a>,  <a href="http://www.almanac.com/astronomy/skywatch" target="_blank">The Old Farmer's Almanac</a>., and the <a href="http://www.amsmeteors.org/meteor-showers/" target="_blank">American Meteor Society</a>. Events on the calendar are organized by date and each is identified with an astronomy icon as outlined below. All dates and times are given in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) must be converted to your local time. You can use the UTC clock below to figure out how many hours to add or subtract for your local time.</p>

      <p><span class="date-text">January 3, 4</span> - <span class="title-text">Quadrantids Meteor Shower. </span>The Quadrantids is an above average shower, with up to 40 meteors per hour at its peak. It is thought to be produced by dust grains left behind by an extinct comet known as 2003 EH1, which was discovered in 2003. The shower runs annually from January 1-5. It peaks this year on the night of the 3rd and  morning of the 4th.  Unfortunately the nearly full moon will block out all but the brightest meteors this year. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Bootes, but can appear anywhere in the sky.</p>

    <li class="b2">
      <p><span class="date-text">January 5</span> - <span class="title-text">Full Moon.</span> The Moon will be located on the opposite side of the Earth as the Sun and its face will be will be fully illuminated. This phase occurs at 04:54 UTC. This full moon was known by early Native American tribes as the Full Wolf Moon because this was the time of year when hungry wolf packs howled outside their camps. This moon has also been know as the Old Moon and the Moon After Yule.</p>

    <li class="b1">
      <p><span class="date-text">January 20</span> - <span class="title-text">New Moon.</span> The Moon will located on the same side of the Earth as the Sun and will not be visible in the night sky. This phase occurs at 13:14 UTC. This is the best time of the month to observe faint objects such as galaxies and star clusters because there is no moonlight to interfere.</p>
    </li>
    
     <li class="b2">
       <p><span class="date-text">February 3</span> - <span class="title-text">Full Moon.</span> The Moon will be located on the opposite side of the Earth as the Sun and its face will be will be fully illuminated. This phase occurs at 23:09 UTC. This full moon was known by early Native American tribes as the Full Snow Moon because the heaviest snows usually fell during this time of the year. Since hunting is difficult, this moon has also been known by some tribes as the Full Hunger Moon, since the harsh weather made hunting difficult.</p>
     </li>
    
    <li class="b5">
      <p><span class="date-text">February 6</span> - <span class="title-text">Jupiter at Opposition.</span> The giant planet will be at its closest approach to Earth and its face will be fully illuminated by the Sun. It will be brighter than any other time of the year and will be visible all night long. This is the best time to view and photograph Jupiter and its moons. A medium-sized telescope should be able to show you some of the details in Jupiter's cloud bands. A good pair of binoculars should allow you to see Jupiter's four largest moons, appearing as bright dots on either side of the planet. </p>

      <p><span class="date-text">February 22</span> - <span class="title-text">Conjunction of Venus and Mars.</span> A conjunction of Venus and Mars will be visible on February 22. The two bright planets will be visible within only half a degree of each other in the evening sky. Look for this impressive sight in the west just after sunset.</p>

      <p><span class="date-text">March 6</span> - <span class="title-text">Dawn at Ceres.</span> NASA’s Dawn spacecraft will encounter the dwarf planet known as Ceres on March 6. Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Because of its size and shape, it has officially been classified as a dwarf planet, which puts it in the same category as Pluto. Ceres is 590 miles (950 kilometers) in diameter and is large enough to have a round shape. Dawn will spend several months studying Ceres and will send back the first close-up images of a dwarf planet in our Solar System.</p>

The Sun will shine directly on the equator and there will be nearly equal amounts of day and night throughout the world. This is also the first day of spring (vernal equinox) in the Northern Hemisphere and the first day of fall (autumnal equinox) in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

      <p><span class="date-text">April 4</span> - <span class="title-text">Full Moon.</span> The Moon will be located on the opposite side of the Earth as the Sun and its face will be will be fully illuminated. This phase occurs at 12:05 UTC. This full moon was known by early Native American tribes as the Full Pink Moon because it marked the appearance of the moss pink, or wild ground phlox, which is one of the first spring flowers. This moon has also been known as the Sprouting Grass Moon, the Growing Moon, and the Egg Moon. Many coastal tribes called it the Full Fish Moon because this was the time that the shad swam upstream to spawn.</p>

      <p><span class="date-text">April 4</span> - <span class="title-text">Total Lunar Eclipse.</span> A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes completely through the Earth's dark shadow, or umbra. During this type of eclipse, the Moon will gradually get darker and then take on a rusty or blood red color. The eclipse will be visible throughout most of North America, South America, eastern Asia, and Australia.
